<h1>Easily Add Depth to Your Web Experiences.</h1>

<h2>🫶 Overview</h2>

<p>ExtrudeUI is an open source React component library that makes it easy to add 3D elements to your web applications. The components aren’t meant to be placed inside of existing 3D scenes, but rather to be placed inside standard 2D websites to add an aspect of depth and interactivity.</p>

<h2>Project Stucture:</h2>

**ExtrudeUI's repo is split into 3 files**

`ExtrudeUI` holds the landing page and local versions of the components for testing

`ExtrudeUI-docs` holds ExtrudeUI's docs

`ExtrudeUI-Components` holds our NPM package for publishing

<h2>🏆 Credits</h2> 



<p>👋 Hey! I'm <a href="https://github.com/Oia20">Jacob Dement</a>, I built ExtrudeUI to make it easier for React developers to add 3D aspects to their web apps. I often found myself writing the same boilerplate React Three Fiber code to add a touch of 3D to my React apps. ExtrudeUI aims to allow others to easily add 3D elements to their web apps, even if they've never touched React Three Fiber before. </p>

This library wouldn't be possible with [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) or [Drei](https://drei.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) check both of these out if you want to dive deeper into the 3D web.
